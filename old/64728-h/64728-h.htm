3</span>CONSIDERATIONS, &amp;c.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Among</span> the characteristics of an Age
replete with new and unlooked-for events, perhaps not the least
singular and impressive is the desire, now extensively evinced,
for an improved translation of Holy Scripture.</p>
<p>A solitary voice, <a name="citation3"></a><a href="#footnote3"
class="citation">[3]</a> it is true, has been raised to the same
effect, from time to time; but it has gradually died away in the
noise of worldly bustle, or been summarily stifled by Prejudice
or Fear.</p>
<p>A more fitting time has arrived for renewing the cry; for we
have become more reflective with the progress of events, and a
desire for improvement&mdash;not limited to mere material
good&mdash;has sprung up, that is irrepressible, and all but
universal.</p>
<p>But, encouraging as is the Temper of the Times for prosecuting
the task that we have undertaken, we need to make our way
cautiously.&nbsp; The subject is confessedly a delicate one, and
is, moreover, in not a few quarters, entrenched in prejudices
under the seeming sanction of religion itself.</p>
<p><a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
4</span>&ldquo;Were the Bible,&rdquo; pleads Dr. Knox, <a
name="citation4"></a><a href="#footnote4"
class="citation">[4]</a> &ldquo;corrected and modernized, it
would probably become more showy, and perhaps quite exact, but it
would lose that air of sanctity which enables it to make an
impression which no accuracy could produce.&nbsp; We have
received the Bible,&rdquo; he goes on to say, &ldquo;in the very
words in which it now stands, from our fathers; we have learnt
many passages from it by heart in our infancy; . . . so that its
phrase is become familiar to our ears, and we cease to be
startled at apparent difficulties.&rdquo;&nbsp; And again:
&ldquo;We should hardly recognize the Bible were it to be read in
our churches in any other words than those which our fathers
heard before us.&rdquo;&nbsp; Possibly the people <i>would</i>
require some time to familiarize themselves to the change, more
especially in the public services of the church; but the
objection, formidable as the good Doctor thought it, is not
sufficient to overrule the plea.&nbsp; Precisely the same
objection, if entertained, would have deprived us of the benefit
of the present authorized version.&nbsp; People long accustomed
to the previous version must have been pained and startled on the
introduction of the new.&nbsp; Such a consequence, however,
obvious as it must have been, was not admitted to be a good
argument against a change at that epoch.&nbsp; True, there are
more readers now than there were then, and so far the
inconvenience of change would be aggravated; but, unless we could
persuade ourselves that we should <i>never</i> have a different
version to the present, we cannot refuse to entertain the
proposition before us in deference to such a consideration.&nbsp;
The notion that we shall <i>always</i> acquiesce in the present
version, with the proofs around us of the possibility of
improving it, coupled with the desire so extensively evinced for
improvement, can scarcely be seriously entertained.</p>
<p>The truth is, the people are not accountable for the reasoning
ascribed to them&mdash;possibly with some justice at <a
name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>the time the
Doctor wrote&mdash;in the above extract.&nbsp; We have given it
at length, because we have nowhere seen the argument, as
generally used, better expressed; but, whatever there is in it,
we hold it a great disparagement to the religious feeling of the
people at the present time, to suppose them capable of putting
Superstition for Piety, as conveyed in the terms of that passage;
or to imagine that anything less than a just and faithful version
of Holy Scripture would or could content them.</p>
<p>But besides the inconvenience of the change so pathetically
pleaded, there is the time-honoured Phraseology of the
Bible&mdash;that phraseology that has earned the suffrages of a
whole people, young and old, rich and poor, learned and
unlearned, and been associated with our Literary glories&mdash;to
warn us off the holy ground.&nbsp; Into what critic&rsquo;s
crucible, it may be asked, do we propose to place the Bible, and
what frigid, tame, and insipid version, among those with which we
have been of late years familiar, do we design to substitute for
our own old authorized translation?</p>
<p>Plainly, none.&nbsp; We know of none&mdash;valuable as some of
them unquestionably are&mdash;worthy of competing, in whole or in
part, on an extended view of the question, with our own; while,
in point of phraseology, to which the objection specifically
refers, the advantage is all in favour of the old version.&nbsp;
But if the question at issue were&mdash;which it is
not&mdash;between Phraseology on the one hand, and Fidelity on
the other, we should and could have no hesitation in deciding for
the latter.&nbsp; But we really think it possible to preserve
most of the beautiful phraseology of the present version, and
even add to it, while we disencumber the text of its errors, and
render it a more faithful reflex of the Divine Original.</p>
<p>But the outward Dress and Ornament of the book do not exhaust
all the objections incident to the question.&nbsp; There are yet
others of a <i>subtler</i> order&mdash;the exponent of deeper
feelings&mdash;to which we must briefly advert.&nbsp; And first,
there are those who find few or no difficulties, for their part,
in the <a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
6</span>Bible, as it now stands, and therefore, naturally enough,
object to a change.&nbsp; The Bible, they maintain, is a plain
book, and the very terms of the Announcement at the head of it,
as a Revelation of God&rsquo;s will to man, upon the knowledge of
which his salvation depends, precludes, they argue, any other
supposition.&nbsp; To a certain extent they are right; and God
forbid we should be understood to mean that the Bible, in its
present English dress, is not satisfactory on all the great
points of faith and duty.&nbsp; We are sometimes told the
contrary, indeed, by those who have formed exaggerated views of
the inadequacies of our version; but such an opinion is entitled
to no manner of respect; on the contrary, it would be very easy
to produce passages&mdash;<i>key-passages</i>, we might call
them, from which the <span class="GutSmall">WHOLE TRUTH</span> of
the Gospel might be extracted&mdash;which would utterly defy any
other translation than that exhibited in the authorized
version.&nbsp; But while conceding all this, we are not debarred
from seeking a version yet nearer perfection than the present, if
it is to be had.&nbsp; There are subordinate lessons, surely,
that might be rendered more precious and instructive; and it
cannot be a right or creditable principle to direct our inquiry
only to that which <i>saves</i>, in the vulgar sense of that
term, and give only a listless and perfunctory attention to all
the rest.&nbsp; Not unfrequently, however this arid notion of the
<i>plainness</i> of Scripture is resolvable into the inert and
abortive state of the faculties in which they are perused.&nbsp;
There is no difficulty, because the subject is not fairly
grappled with.&nbsp; The words titillate and amuse, while the
sense is in the clouds.&nbsp; More respectable is that
tranquillizing and elevating feeling which oftentimes accompanies
the reading, in which the understanding, though not dead, is
still at fault through the veil interposed by the
phraseology.&nbsp; This placid acquiescence of the soul in a
message the exact purpose of which it fails to comprehend, may be
taken to express a tacit homage to the power of the Divine Spirit
breathing through the words, however feebly enunciated; <a
name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>and there may
be still, under the happiest methods of elucidating Scripture yet
open to us, a just and legitimate scope for its exercise:
nevertheless, we covet habitually, and as a general principle,
the discharge of a higher function of the soul,&mdash;<span
class="GutSmall">TO UNDERSTAND</span> as well as <span
class="GutSmall">TO FEEL</span>, and <span class="GutSmall">TO
ACT</span> as well as <span class="GutSmall">TO BE ACTED
ON</span>.</p>
<p>But while these find Scripture so plain as to be able to
dispense with the Critic&rsquo;s art, and all other aid, to throw
further light on their contents, there are those, on the other
hand, who love a Mysterious Bible, and to whom the whole science
of Biblical interpretation is positively distasteful, as
savouring of the wisdom of man rather than of the grace of the
Spirit.&nbsp; They find their devotion fed, as they think, by the
Mystical element, and revel in difficulties that to others are
simply discomfiting.&nbsp; Cloud-land is their home.&nbsp;
Accordingly, to relieve Scripture of its obscurities, and render
it more patent and intelligible, is the last service for which we
might expect their thanks.&nbsp; While this is a genuine
feeling,&mdash;indulged in for the special delectation of their
own bosoms&mdash;and not a pretence to ensnare others, or
inveigle their weaker brethren in the toils of a spiritual
autocracy, it is simply an error of the brain&mdash;an
idiosyncrasy, to be treated with all due gentleness and
consideration.&nbsp; Let such, then, observe that there is no
reason why Scripture should be more difficult in the translation
than it is in the original, or than God designed it, or inspired
men transmitted it to us; and that the aim of these and similar
efforts is simply to ensure a version that will exhibit the Word
of God with at least equal force and perspicuity to that
presented in the original text.&nbsp; Nor would a genuine
reverence for Scripture allow us to stop short of this point,
since anything less must be so much clear loss of most important
Truth.&nbsp; There are many who are grievously perplexed by the
obscurity that attaches to certain portions of Scripture, and for
their sakes, as well as for the obvious duty of the case, we
insist upon all the aid we can procure to elucidate <a
name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>those
portions.&nbsp; To take one instance&mdash;a striking
one&mdash;the Messianic prophecies&mdash;those prophecies in not
a few instances now portraying the Messiah in unmistakable
lineaments, and now, without the slightest hint of a change of
subject, <a name="citation8a"></a><a href="#footnote8a"
class="citation">[8a]</a> varying the portrait, as by a
dissolving process, so that it seems no longer <span
class="GutSmall">HIMSELF</span> that is set before us, but one of
the erring children of men.&nbsp; Now, evidently, it would be
most desirable, if a new version could obviate or relieve this
difficulty.&nbsp; In sundry instances the sense is marred by an
incongruousness in the metaphors, <a name="citation8b"></a><a
href="#footnote8b" class="citation">[8b]</a> for which the Bible,
perhaps, is the last book in the world to be made answerable; and
this particular fault, in most instances, a slight change in the
<i>pointing</i>, for which the context would give <a
name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>the fullest
warrant, or a juster translation, would satisfactorily amend.</p>
<p>But will not a new translation endanger those articles of our
faith in which we have been brought up from our infancy, and
which we believe to be essential to salvation?&nbsp; May not the
translation fall into the hands of those who are ill-affected to
the orthodox faith, and is there not ground to believe that
hostility to that faith is the real object of many of those who
are most conspicuous in the promotion of this scheme?</p>
<p>This apprehension we believe to lie at the basis of much of
the objection that is entertained to the proposed change: but has
it not occurred to the alarmists, that the weapon cuts both ways,
and that it is just as possible, as far as at present appears,
for the other side to be discomfited in the shock?&nbsp; Who
shall say that the Evangelical or Orthodox scheme shall not gain
ground by the experiment, and the opposite scheme suffer?&nbsp;
But these objections are manifestly unworthy a belief that
professedly rests as its basis on the Word of God; rather is it a
belief in the words which man&rsquo;s wisdom teacheth, not which
the Holy Ghost teacheth.&nbsp; And with regard to the individuals
that may be selected for the task, surely all anxiety on that
ground is superfluous.&nbsp; The general sense of Scripture is
not now to be determined: that has been done long ago; and all
that remains for us is, in the use of such means as our advancing
scholarship supplies, to make that sense&mdash;as Providence from
time to time supplies the opportunity&mdash;yet more explicit,
and available for proficiency in Divine knowledge.</p>
<p>Thus far we have been occupied in clearing our ground, and
essaying a hearing, with what chance of success we might,
considering the outcry, more or less reasonable, with which the
question before us is usually met.&nbsp; We take no further
notice of the objections to our task, and proceed to explain more
distinctly in what that task consists.&nbsp; But, first of all,
we must premise, that we contemplate a &ldquo;revised&rdquo; <a
name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>rather than
an entirely &ldquo;new&rdquo; version.&nbsp; Certain feelings
have entwined themselves round the stock of the present version
which it would not be safe or needful to sever, except where the
imperious demands of fidelity to the sense necessitate the
infliction.</p>
<p>The fiat given to the use of the old authorized version is
substantially honourable to the nation&mdash;perhaps equally so
with the fiat that gave it existence.&nbsp; There is a pregnant
power in the words, as symbols of the burning <i>thoughts</i> of
the men engaged, not pale reflexes of <i>things</i>, that has
secured the all but universal use of the present version, with
all its imperfections, despite the labours of Lowth, and Horsley,
and Campbell, and Henderson, and Good, and others&mdash;all
eminent names&mdash;more or less to displace it.&nbsp; &ldquo;The
Spirit of the Living Creatures was in the Wheels, and whither the
Wheels were to go the Spirit of the Living Creatures went with
them.&rdquo; <a name="citation10a"></a><a href="#footnote10a"
class="citation">[10a]</a></p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Foremost</span> in the conditions
of a correct version is <span class="smcap">Purity of
Text</span>.&rsquo;&nbsp; There is no doubt, we believe, in the
minds of all qualified to pronounce on this part of the question,
that the text, both of the Old and New Testament, generally
unassailable as it is, is yet, on some not unimportant
points&mdash;and what is unimportant in such a
document?&mdash;susceptible of improvement.&nbsp; We wish, by all
means, to have the benefit of this improved text, as no
consideration of <i>consequences</i> can weigh against the
<i>actual</i> inconveniences that belong to the text, in some
instances, as it now stands.&nbsp; The discrepancies, for
example, in the Chronicles, <a name="citation10b"></a><a
href="#footnote10b" class="citation">[10b]</a> in matters <a
name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>relating to
<i>numbers</i>, with the statements in the corresponding passages
in 2 Samuel and Kings, furnish most damaging weapons in sceptical
hands wherewith to assail the Sacred Books.&nbsp; Some of these
discrepancies are only imaginary, but others, it must be
confessed, are palpable and incontrovertible, and ought not to
stand, as they now do, in our Bibles, open, without a word
appearing on the page in their defence, to the most unmitigated
contradiction. <a name="citation11a"></a><a href="#footnote11a"
class="citation">[11a]</a>&nbsp; The fact is, the text in these
instances is <i>corrupt</i>, and there need be no scruple,
considering the way in which <span
class="GutSmall">NUMBERS</span> were variously written of old, by
letters, ciphers, or words, and more especially the liability of
transcribers to err in these matters, in arriving at that
conclusion.&nbsp; This extreme devotion to the Massoretic text on
the part of our translators, to the overthrow of common sense,
and disregard of the thousand arguments that plead for a change
over the one thus pertinaciously followed, is most detrimental to
the credit of the Sacred Volumes; for two statements
diametrically opposed cannot, of course, be both correct; the
weaker, therefore, should naturally be made to give place to the
stronger.&nbsp; In some cases, <i>possibly</i>, this may be done
by a new recension of the text; in others the alteration should
be summarily made in conformity with the obvious maxims in
universal use for determining the truth in the case of
contradictory documents. <a name="citation11b"></a><a
href="#footnote11b" class="citation">[11b]</a></p>
<p>Next to Purity of Text is a <span class="smcap">Correct
Version</span>.&nbsp; That the present version does not satisfy
this condition in the just sense of the word, or to the extent we
have a right to require in such a matter, is now almost
universally conceded.&nbsp; The plea of &ldquo;good enough&rdquo;
is given up, and the wishes of the religious public for a
translation more true to <a name="page12"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 12</span>the original, are
&ldquo;condescendingly&rdquo; admitted to be just and reasonable;
and if this admission expressed the voice of authority, as well
as the general sense of the learned world, our wishes would
speedily be in a condition to be fulfilled.&nbsp; Meantime it is
for us to agitate the question till the boon be accorded,
agreeably to the good old English rule, when the stronghold of
authority is to be stormed.</p>
<p>It has appeared to us, in the prosecution of our task, that we
could put this question before the ordinary English reader in a
form to enable him to determine for himself with tolerable
correctness the Validity of our plea for a more correct version
of Holy Writ.&nbsp; <i>On such a point it is important he should
be able to judge for himself</i>: accordingly, we shall exhibit
sundry amended passages, by way of specimen, in
<i>juxtaposition</i> with the corresponding passages of the
present version.&nbsp; It may be premised, that it is not
necessary that the amended translation should be in all respects
immaculate and unassailable; it suffices for the present purpose
if we establish the fact, that the authorized version <i>is</i>
capable of amendment.&nbsp; The field before us is almost
illimitable, so numerous are the corrections that require to be
supplied.&nbsp; Of course, we must pick our path here and
there.&nbsp; We begin with the Old Testament; and here two
passages recommend themselves for selection, as well for their
own intrinsic interest as for the materials they afford for
elucidating the principles that underlie the transfusion of
Hebrew into English.&nbsp; The reader is invited to ponder the
two versions in the points in which they differ, however minute
the difference at first sight may appear, as the change in these
cases has proceeded upon a strictly literal translation of the
original Hebrew; and the variation, on a further view, may not
appear so unimportant as at first.&nbsp; Our first passage
consists of extracts from the Song of Deborah, Judges v., and the
amended version is due, substantially, to the able pen of Dr.
Edward Robinson, Translator of Gesenius, &amp;c.&nbsp; See
&ldquo;Biblical Repository.&rdquo;&nbsp; Two other versions of
the <a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>same
Song are given by Dr. Adam Clarke in his Commentary, from Dr.
Hales and Dr. Kennicott respectively; but, with all their merit,
they are less literally true to the original, and therefore less
eligible for selection, than the one we have adopted:&mdash;</p>

<p><a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>We here
pause, before proceeding to our second extract, to notice one
very damaging source of mistranslation as applicable to the Old
Testament.&nbsp; We allude to what may be called the use of the
Prophetical or Theological scheme in dealing with the
Prophecies.&nbsp; For instance, in the 2nd verse of 53rd chap, of
Isaiah, as below, the words &ldquo;<i>for he shall grow
up</i>&rdquo; ought to be rendered &ldquo;<i>and</i>&rdquo; or
&ldquo;<i>so</i>&rdquo; (resuming the argument of the previous
chapter) &ldquo;<i>he grew up</i>&rdquo; in the <span
class="GutSmall">PAST</span> tense; and so on through the
chapter.&nbsp; The Prophets, it is well known, in the vividness
of their prophetic vision, contemplated the future events that
passed under their ken as <i>actually past</i>; <a
name="citation14"></a><a href="#footnote14"
class="citation">[14]</a> and as this is a prominent
characteristic of <a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
15</span>their mode of delivering prophetic truth, it ought not
to be lost sight of in a translation.&nbsp; The explanation of
the <i>fact</i> that what they spoke of as actually past was
still future, belongs to what is called &ldquo;exegesis,&rdquo;
and stands out as an Order of Rhetoric significant of, and sacred
to, their prophetic function; but by no means should such an
element enter into a translation, which, if it does not present a
faithful reflex of the original, is simply a misnomer.&nbsp; Not
that there is any inviolable uniformity in the practice of the
translators in the use of this scheme.&nbsp; Far from it; as is
evident from the translation that follows.&nbsp; And this serves
to render a subject, necessarily obscure from its very nature,
immeasurably more so.&nbsp; The truth is, we have here forced
upon us the fact, that the translators were not fully acquainted
with a principle of the language&mdash;now well
understood&mdash;that lies at the basis of the whole structure.
<a name="citation15"></a><a href="#footnote15"
class="citation">[15]</a>&nbsp; They saw its force&mdash;they
could not help doing so&mdash;in the Narrative portions, but were
not cognizant of it as a Fundamental principle of the language,
applicable alike to all subjects, and not variable and flexible
at the pleasure of the interpreter.</p>
<p>We are sorry we can adduce no particular name on which to cast
the responsibility of the following amended version.&nbsp; We
have consulted very many of the most distinguished of those who
have laboured to translate this, in some respects, <a
name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>very
intricate passage, and what we have given must be considered
mainly as an <i>amalgam</i> of the joint labours of them
all.&nbsp; We are far from thinking we have given the best
version possible; and <i>perhaps</i> the text itself, where the
difficulty is peculiarly pressing, may yet be found susceptible
of improvement:&mdash;</p>

far for the Old Testament.&nbsp; We adopt a somewhat different

of exhibiting the two versions in juxtaposition.&nbsp; The
amended passages that follow are taken, with a few exceptions,
from Professor Scholefield&rsquo;s &ldquo;Hints for an Improved
Translation of the New Testament.&rdquo;&nbsp; They are, it is
presumed, sufficiently important to warrant the selection, but it
must be premised that it is not by taking isolated passages for
emendation that the <span class="GutSmall">WHOLE TRUTH</span>
insisted upon in these pages can be enforced.&nbsp; There are
numberless points of correction of which our version is
susceptible that are not adapted for such isolated exhibition,
and which it is the special business of the Greek particles to
supply; but the exhibition of such points, involving the
structure of sentences and the mutual relation of the clauses of
which they are made up, would require a much larger
canvass.&nbsp; We indicate this source of correction only to
avert the conclusion, that our argument rests solely on the basis
supplied in the particular mode of illustration adopted.</p>

continues alive.</p>

<p>Thus far, by way of specimen of the improvement of which the
authorized version is susceptible on the score of fidelity to the
original.&nbsp; The instances might have been multiplied
indefinitely, but we designed only a specimen.&nbsp; <a
name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 24</span>We would
repeat that there is a large amount of improvement practicable in
elucidating and enforcing the sense, when it is not positively
misrepresented, that is less fitted for such display, and which
alone it would require the transcription of a large portion of
the Bible to render apparent.</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;Claudite jam
rivos pueri; sat prata biberunt.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We have indeed said enough to justify our plea, and here we
might close the evidence, but we are tempted further to observe
that the sense of Scripture is not only obscured in the
authorized version by errors of translation, but there is almost
an equal amount of mischief done to the sense by the present mode
of distributing the subject-matter into chapter and verse; for
which, as is well known, there is no valid authority, <a
name="citation24a"></a><a href="#footnote24a"
class="citation">[24a]</a> either as regards the Old or the New
Testament.&nbsp; This fault it is the special object of the new
Paragraph Bible lately published by the Religious Tract Society,
to remedy.&nbsp; We confine ourselves to two illustrations.</p>
<p>The 53rd chapter of Isaiah begins with a parenthesis,
(&lsquo;Who hath believed our report, and to whom has the arm of
the Lord been revealed?&rsquo;) <a name="citation24b"></a><a
href="#footnote24b" class="citation">[24b]</a>&nbsp; This, in our
view, is a <a name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
25</span><i>soliloquy</i> into which the prophet breaks forth in
relief of his feelings, while contemplating the overpowering
events that pass in review before him, coupled with the rejection
of the message by the great body of his countrymen. <a
name="citation25a"></a><a href="#footnote25a"
class="citation">[25a]</a>&nbsp; These events had already begun
their career at the 13th verse of the foregoing chapter, and they
go steadily on through the remainder of that, and the whole of
the following chapter, broken only by the ejaculation of the
prophet, thus violently wrenched from its place, as the matter
now stands.</p>
<p>The other instance we adduce of the obscuration of the sense
occasioned by the present faulty distribution of the
letter-press, occurs Joshua v. and vi.&nbsp; It is an example of
an analogous kind to that already given.&nbsp; It makes a
parenthesis used simply in explanation of a series of
instructions from the Lord to Joshua to vacate its place in the
narrative, and actually stand at the commencement of a new
chapter, in which the same series of instructions is still
continued.&nbsp; See the &ldquo;Edinburgh Review&rdquo; for
October last. <a name="citation25b"></a><a href="#footnote25b"
class="citation">[25b]</a>&nbsp; We shall place the old and new
arrangement in juxta-position, when the violence done to the
sense, as the matter now stands, will be apparent at once.</p>

<p>The reader will observe in the above paragraph that, in
addition to a better distribution of the letter-press, we have
given the <i>spoken language</i> in italics, with inverted
commas,&mdash;a character of type we recommend to be carried out
continuously in the revised version, as it, actually is with
excellent effect, in the new Paragraph Bible.&nbsp; These may be
thought small matters, but we have been led to mention them as
thinking the adoption of them will give facility, not merely to
the private, but also to the <i>viv&acirc; voce</i> reading of
Scripture,&mdash;a point surely not undeserving of attention.</p>
<p>Connected with these desiderata are others of a minor
character, as&mdash;an improved punctuation&mdash;the
substitution of vernacular for obsolete words&mdash;the use of
<i>euphemisms</i> where the allusion is obvious, and no violence
is done to the sense&mdash;appropriate concise headings to the
different sections in the margin&mdash;<i>chronological
arrangement of the several books</i>&mdash;chronological data,
&amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
<p>We are proceeding beyond the strict limits we assigned to
ourselves in the course of these last remarks, and scarcely
venture further in recommending attention&mdash;though especially
worthy of it, in the case of a Book we wish to make universally
attractive,&mdash;to what may be called the
<i>&aelig;sthetics</i> of <i>book-making</i>.&nbsp; We all know
the advantage of a readable type, open space between the lines,
paragraphs and smaller divisions clearly indicated, large margin,
&amp;c.; and though, in comparison with our main object, these
are small matters, they yet constitute distinct items in the Roll
of convenience, and therefore merit attention&mdash;especially in
subserviency to the object of giving to the Bible the adjuncts
appropriate to a <span class="GutSmall">HOUSEHOLD
BOOK</span>.</p>
<p>Such is an outline of what we hope to see done.&nbsp; We might
have multiplied instances of mistranslation to an unlimited <a
name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 27</span>extent, and
many other improvements conducing to a clearer exposition of the
sense of Scripture might have been suggested: but we stop
here.&nbsp; Enough has been said to substantiate our argument,
and we desist from the present line of thought to indulge the
flattering belief that we have at length gained our object; that,
in fact, we have a Bible such as we have invoked&mdash;with a
purer text,&mdash;a correcter version,&mdash;and other appliances
better adapted to fit it for the high ends for which it was
given, than the present.&nbsp; What, now, it may be asked, are
the <i>peculiar advantages</i> we promise ourselves from the
<span class="GutSmall">ACQUISITION</span>?&nbsp; Some advantages
seem to flow very naturally and directly from the measure; and
one that we may very confidently anticipate is, a keener
perception and appreciation of Scripture in its fundamental
qualities of truthfulness, power, and majesty, as the volume is
spread out before us with increased effulgence, and life-likeness
to the original.&nbsp; The whole orb of truth will shine out with
a brightness of which it is now in part shorn through defect in
the instrument by means of which it is viewed.&nbsp; Moreover,
the <i>evidences</i> for the Divine authority of the sacred books
would be yet clearer, as blemishes were eliminated, obscurities
cleared up, weak parts strengthened.&nbsp; The evidences of
Christianity, in their brightest array, and most decisive effect,
lie in the sacred oracles themselves.&nbsp; They vouch for their
own authority.&nbsp; How potent a power this is may be judged of
from the fact that they are accredited by those to whom they not
only show no favour, but the most decided and uncompromising
hostility!&nbsp; Many circumstances wrongfully accredited to them
mar and weaken the evidence; but these, however perplexing in
some cases, and damaging&mdash;as the text now stands&mdash;in
others, cannot overlay their credibility.&nbsp; There are,
moreover, doctrines embedded in their pages that appeal solely to
faith, and that receive our assent mainly as part and parcel of a
<span class="smcap">Book</span> that we deem divine.&nbsp; It is
the word of God, and we turn away at our peril from the voice
that speaks to us from <a name="page28"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 28</span><span
class="GutSmall">HEAVEN</span>.&nbsp; Certain passages there are,
as we think, so impressed with the character of Divinity, so
reassuring of a divine utterance, and so marvellously radiant
with truth, that, under the full force of the impression, the
whole soul resigns itself to the spell, and faith is scarcely so
much a voluntary emotion as a necessity.&nbsp; We believe because
we have no alternative. <a name="citation28"></a><a
href="#footnote28" class="citation">[28]</a>&nbsp; Such is the
power of the sacred oracles in themselves to command
belief.&nbsp; Nevertheless, the evidence generally of their
divine authority would be yet more conclusive, as the result of a
version more true to the sacred text.&nbsp; The Divine voice
would be still more audible.&nbsp; The arguments <a
name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 29</span>that have
hitherto commanded our assent would acquire fresh force, while
obstacles and imperfections would dwindle into insignificance, or
altogether disappear.&nbsp; The force of our plea could scarcely
present itself more strongly.&nbsp; The Scriptures themselves
constitute the great battle-field of the argument affecting a
Divine Revelation.&nbsp; The question is decided in the minds of
thousands, on considerations drawn from <i>the Scriptures
themselves</i>,&mdash;in virtue, that is, of their own
credentials, and not on the elaborate speculations or ingenious
apologies of (assumed) interested advocates.&nbsp; A more direct
and forcible evidence is required for men in no ecclesiastical
position to forestall opinion, and with little time or ability to
enter into abstruse and recondite arguments.&nbsp; The ordinary
books of evidences, however effective <i>concurrently</i> with
the evidence furnished by Scripture itself (and in this way they
are&mdash;many of them&mdash;doubtless exceedingly useful), are
not <i>alone</i>, and, in the absence of such corroboration,
calculated to produce the evidence that is desired to rebut the
counter arguments to which human nature in its infirmity is
assailed.&nbsp; It requires the re-assuring voice of God himself
to give the requisite confidence and satisfaction.&nbsp; Hence we
have sufficiently indicated the field to which our labours may be
most successfully directed while endeavouring to establish and
diffuse, in their most telling and cogent form, the evidences of
the Christian faith.</p>
<p>Moreover, a competent knowledge of Biblical erudition would,
under the new conditions of the Holy Books, be no longer so
costly or onerous as at present.&nbsp; Truly, this is a great
desideratum.&nbsp; The mass of reading now required to peruse
Scripture with due edification and interest is altogether beyond
the leisure of the busy, or the means of the less affluent: and
to be doomed to hopeless ignorance of so much enlightenment as is
symbolized in the goodly tomes that meet the eye on every side,
devoted to the elucidation of Holy Writ, is by no means
satisfactory.&nbsp; With this <a name="page30"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 30</span>partial distribution of spiritual
advantages, the Christian Church seems drifting away from its
fundamental basis of <i>universality</i>, and,&mdash;in the very
spirit and wake of heathenism,&mdash;abetting and consecrating
the principle of an esoteric and exoteric school&mdash;a pet and
a common class of disciples&mdash;the one furnished with all the
erudition&mdash;the prime secrets and witcheries of
knowledge&mdash;the other abandoned to the merest generalities, a
sorry heap of prejudices, or at best a dubious and insufficient
light.&nbsp; But however this be, certain it is there is now
available a vast amount of Biblical lore of no mean value, and
which no good Christian would willingly forego, that is all but
sealed to the bulk of the Christian world. <a
name="citation30"></a><a href="#footnote30"
class="citation">[30]</a>&nbsp; The publication of Scripture on
the principles we advocate would go far to remedy the evil.&nbsp;
The beautiful emendations of the Sacred text that are now
scattered over a wide waste of territory, and all but lost, would
be garnered up, and made available for common use.&nbsp; The
occasional criticisms of Archbishop Whately, for instance, and
the <a name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
31</span>specific emendations of the late Professor Scholefield,
would become alike the property of the esoterics and the
exoterics: they would be treasured up and embalmed in our own
Bibles.&nbsp; In a word, we should succeed to a large inheritance
of the labours of others.&nbsp; There would be still much left,
of course, to reward industry and sagacity, and succeeding times
might fairly expect to have the benefit of all future discoveries
in this important field.&nbsp; The immediate benefit would be to
relieve the unlettered from dependence on the Commentary to the
extent they now are.&nbsp; They who run might read. <a
name="citation31"></a><a href="#footnote31"
class="citation">[31]</a></p>
<p>We may further be entitled to expect some abatement of our
present unchristian differences, which are fostered to some
extent, as we think, by the difficulties inherent in the Book
rather as a <i>translation</i> than as an <i>original</i>.&nbsp;
To some extent it gives a less certain sound, as it is obliged to
avail itself of human organs.&nbsp; By repairing the instrument,
we may find a great impediment to our common understanding and
accord removed, while the union thus formed will be all the more
valuable as it will be real, not simulated&mdash;uniform, not
patched up for the occasion to defeat a common enemy.&nbsp; It
will grow out of the only bond of union&mdash;sympathy, namely,
of belief&mdash;that promises to be permanent and available in
the hour of trial.&nbsp; Divers forms of worship, and many
varying shades of opinion, may co-exist with this unity.&nbsp;
Charity thinketh no evil, is not easily provoked.&nbsp; If this
happy purpose <a name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
32</span>could be secured by imparting a clearer light to the
firmament of Christian truth, as the result of the measure we
advocate, it would not be easy to overrate the boon in the
removal of the scandal that belongs to the present divided state
of Christendom, and in the service it would render to the church
in carrying out her many offices of healing and comfort to the
world.</p>
<p>Still further: Popular Education, to the extent to which it is
identified with the Bible, would be subserved by an improved
translation.&nbsp; In many parts of the kingdom the Bible, as is
well known, is the only organ of education available&mdash;the
only apparatus by which any ray of intellectual light finds
entrance into men&rsquo;s minds.&nbsp; This may be accounted for
from the fact that, in addition to knowledge, Scripture brings
with it <i>the soul&rsquo;s health</i>; otherwise, in the rude
state in which it finds a large portion of the population, it
would have small chance of fulfilling this incidental office of
educating the masses.&nbsp; In this light Scripture, where, as in
Protestant countries, it is freely diffused, must be regarded as
a most precious boon to a nation&mdash;as a guarantee, in fact,
that the people shall be in some sort educated, and invested with
the attributes of rational and responsible beings.&nbsp; Nor is
the benefit of Scripture, as a help to education, confined to the
poor: in early youth it smooths the entrance on the path of
knowledge, not less effectually to the rich than to the
indigent.&nbsp; There is, moreover, to be considered the part
that Scripture plays in the education of the land, in the actual
occupancy it enjoys in almost every family as a <span
class="GutSmall">HOUSEHOLD BOOK</span>, available as the Urim and
Thummim of the ancient economy, and actually doing that service
which the &ldquo;lares and lemures&rdquo; of heathen households
were vainly invoked to perform.&nbsp; It is in vain to exclaim
against this state of things, from whatever motive, sceptical or
superstitious: the fact is as we have stated it, and, with the
absence of such means of education, the country, to a large
extent, must necessarily be uneducated.</p>
<p><a name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 33</span>Thus
obviously is the Bible the recognized organ of popular education
in this country, and in this view it is most important that its
efficiency should be complete.&nbsp; But this inference derives
its chief force from considerations affecting the
<i>character</i> of the education it supplies.&nbsp; In this
aspect of it there is nothing that should make us regret the
actual occupancy it enjoys in this regard.&nbsp; On the contrary,
it is admirably adapted by its own peculiar power over
men&rsquo;s souls to create&mdash;not a learned, but an
intelligent people; and if intelligent, then free, independent,
powerful,&mdash;a match for tyranny in every shape, and at every
turn.&nbsp; Nor are the ruling powers themselves less benefited
in thus being able to lay deep the foundation of their authority
in the fixedness of principle, just appreciation of good as
distinct from its counterfeit, and sober and well-advised aims of
the people so trained and nurtured.</p>
<p>Closely connected with education, or such an education as we
have now been considering, is <i>public morality</i>, and with it
the strength and prosperity of a Nation.&nbsp; The condition of
England in her various phases&mdash;civil, military, political,
and religious&mdash;has naturally arrested the attention of
intelligent foreigners, as presenting a marked superiority in
these respects, or in some of them, to their own country.&nbsp;
They have inquired the cause of this distinction with little
success, and are as much at fault in being able to trace no
symptoms of decay or flagging vitality in the system, cruelly
tried as it not unfrequently is, prognosticating its ruin.&nbsp;
Perhaps there is a solution of the enigma here.&nbsp; Perhaps the
use of Scripture as the prime material of our early education has
generated a better morality among us, and precluded the admission
of certain forms of evil, little consonant to national greatness
or national welfare, from which we see other countries,
differently schooled, are not exempt.&nbsp; On this head, while
avoiding undue pretension, we would not choose to say less than
truth permits.&nbsp; With all the deductions to be allowed in
disparagement of our claim to a high <a name="page34"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 34</span>place in the scale of morals
absolutely, we have yet, as compared with other
countries,&mdash;a conscience, a sense namely of right and wrong,
pervading the bulk of the people, and leavening the land with a
wholesome morality,&mdash;we are not habituated to treat suicide
as a virtue, <a name="citation34"></a><a href="#footnote34"
class="citation">[34]</a>&mdash;our functionaries, as a body, are
not venal,&mdash;we are not dangerous to the State when we meet
in numbers beyond two or three,&mdash;and we are not incapable of
self-government.&nbsp; M. de Montalembert, in his late work on
the Future of England, while generously doing homage to the
greatness of this country, the destinies of which he undertakes
to decide, has not adverted to this high moral and religious
training as supplying any explanation of the phenomenon: perhaps
deeming his own country to be not less amply supplied with the
means of religious culture.&nbsp; On this point we are at issue
with him, if such is his opinion.&nbsp; In France, as in Catholic
countries generally,&mdash;and it must be confessed in some
Protestant countries too,&mdash;it is not so decidedly a
religious or moral, as <a name="page35"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 35</span>an ecclesiastical and conventual
training, that is accorded; one, that is, which, while it
overlays the memory with dogmas, and deals in technical and
artificial requirements, leaves the conscience all but
uninformed, and morality, as a pervading, practical, germinating
principle, almost a non-entity. <a name="citation35"></a><a
href="#footnote35" class="citation">[35]</a></p>
<p><i>Paullo majora canamus</i>.&nbsp; The time is come when
countries, as such, need to be educated no less really than
smaller bodies and isolated individuals.&nbsp; Countries are
brought now almost into as close contact with one another as
individual members of the same commonwealth; and the identical
principle that inculcates the education of
individuals&mdash;that, namely, of mutual self-defence and
reciprocal advantage&mdash;applies to the aggregation of
individuals in a nation.&nbsp; The times of ignorance picture to
us man as a savage, a terror to his neighbours, and everywhere an
object of rightful destruction.&nbsp; Education became a
necessity, if he would be safe from violence, or reap advantage
from the society of his fellow.&nbsp; The picture presented by
the history of nations in relation to one another is
substantially the same.&nbsp; There has been little improvement
in this respect yet visible.&nbsp; Nor has the necessity for it
seemed urgent, while the nations were separated by the natural
obstacles of their position, and their means of mutual annoyance
in a corresponding degree circumscribed.&nbsp; Science has now
removed these obstacles, and the nations are brought into
immediate contiguity and contact, while their means of mutual
annoyance have been enormously and frightfully multiplied.&nbsp;
Startling it is to think of the growing power of nations for
evil, and inflicting evil upon one another, in the present temper
<a name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 36</span>and
<i>morale</i> of the nations.&nbsp; Surely we may say the time
has come for providing a remedy appropriate to so fearful a
crisis.&nbsp; There is none that occurs to us so sure as a system
of instruction that recognizes as its basis a <i>sanctity</i> in
the relations of state with state, and lodges deep in the
consciences of the several people those great principles of
justice, truth, and benevolence, in which God has indissolubly
bound up all human happiness, whether of nations or of
individuals.&nbsp; Unhappily there is so much to unlearn on the
subject of the relative duties of nations to one another before
this good work can be proceeded in.&nbsp; The sacred records have
not been supposed to furnish any lessons on this branch of human
duty, and none have been sought for.&nbsp; But&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;In them is plainest taught and easiest
learn&rsquo;d<br />
What makes a Nation happy, and keeps it so.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">Paradise
Regained</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Embued with the conviction that we have the means adequate to
the high ends here proposed in these very records&mdash;well
understood and properly carried out&mdash;we have ventured upon
these high themes in disregard of the imputation to which we may
be subjected, with some plausibility, of overstating our
cause.&nbsp; We say with some plausibility, only as merging our
feelings for the moment in the superficial view ordinarily taken
of the <i>real character</i> of the religious element&mdash;a
view altogether ignored by the history of our race, and the
peculiar phenomena of the times.&nbsp; We may add, it is
unmistakably at variance with the consciousness of almost every
individual in Christendom, to whom it is no secret that religious
questions&mdash;unless the interest has been neutralized by long
neglect, or quashed by desperate violence&mdash;exert a strange
and engrossing power over his soul.&nbsp; In whatever way we look
at it, it is a <i>power</i>, and in this view may even be
perverted to evil.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose ye,&rdquo; says Christ, &ldquo;that I am come
to send <a name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
37</span>peace upon earth?&nbsp; I tell you, Nay, but rather
division.&rdquo; <a name="citation37a"></a><a href="#footnote37a"
class="citation">[37a]</a>&nbsp; In deep sympathy with these
words, and in corroboration of the prophetic spirit by which they
are marked, are the following observations of Stanley, when
summing up his reminiscences of the Lake of Galilee&mdash;the
toiling all night and catching nothing&mdash;the great multitude
of fishes, so that the net broke&mdash;the casting a hook for the
first fish that came up&mdash;the net cast into the sea, and
gathering of every kind: &ldquo;all these,&rdquo; says he,
&ldquo;are images which could occur nowhere else in Palestine but
in this one spot, and which, from that one spot, have now passed
into the religious language of the civilized world, <i>and in
their remotest applications</i>, <i>or even misapplications</i>,
<i>have converted the nations</i>, <i>and shaken the thrones of
Europe</i>.&rdquo; <a name="citation37b"></a><a
href="#footnote37b" class="citation">[37b]</a></p>
<p>Thus demonstrative it is that Religion is no weak, idle,
evanescent figment of man&rsquo;s imagination, but a real,
substantial, controlling power, shaping his thoughts, it may be
unconsciously, and blending itself with the solid structure of
society and nations.&nbsp; Greece and Rome, it has been well
said, have attracted here and there a visitor, but only the Holy
Land has provoked a crusade.&nbsp; Nor is the evidence of its
power to be fetched wholly from the records of the past; we think
we see in it in our own days a germinating principle more potent
than anything else now in operation to work great changes, and
rival, at least, if it does not throw into the shade, all that
history has yet unfolded.&nbsp; That this power may be based in
knowledge, and directed to a righteous end, unlike the character
oftentimes it bears on the page of the past, it may deserve some
consideration as a means to this end, whether we may not yet read
our lesson to greater advantage, and educe from the sacred page a
fuller amount of good than in its present state it is calculated
to afford.&nbsp; And we have the more confidence in urging our
present suit, because we are persuaded that the boon we invoke
will not long be unattended with other forms of <a
name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 38</span>active
beneficence conducing to the same high ends.&nbsp; The church
will almost simultaneously rouse herself to new exertion.&nbsp; A
yet more effective order of Religious Teaching than we can yet
boast of&mdash;from the pulpit and the press, will probably be
elicited.&nbsp; And thus we shall evoke, not an isolated power
waging dubious war against fearful odds, but a <span
class="GutSmall">CONFEDERATE</span> force, equal, we will hope,
to the crisis;&mdash;a crisis such as, no one is so obtuse as not
to see, demands something vastly in advance of the elements at
present available for neutralizing the fearful evils now
festering at our core, or looming in the no distant horizon.</p>
<p>Such is our argument.&nbsp; The sum is, that the Sacred Books
are replete with good, and that a just appreciation of what is
due to our own interests, no less than gratitude for the gift
itself, demands from us the consecration of whatever further
power Providence has, in these latter days, conferred upon us to
that end, to render that good in its utmost extent salutary and
efficacious.</p>
<p>And the time for action presses.&nbsp; Already various
undertakings are on foot to supply the desired object: and there
may be reason to fear, in the failure of help from higher
quarters, that some Society&mdash;the Religious Tract Society,
for example, as suggested by the &ldquo;Edinburgh Review,&rdquo;
thus following up its recent excellent publication of the New
Paragraph Bible&mdash;or some self-constituted body, as is this
moment sitting in America for this very purpose&mdash;or
individual scholars&mdash;may appropriate the ground we should
rather reserve as the Special Sphere for the operations of the
highest Authority in the realm.</p>
<p>It only remains that we give utterance to our most fervent
hope that this great work may signalize the reign of our beloved
Queen.&nbsp; It will not be the least sparkling of the diamonds
that will lend lustre to her crown.&nbsp; All concurrent
circumstances point to this as the fitting time, and to her
Majesty as the appropriate individual to inaugurate the
solemnity.&nbsp; Religious scruples have given way to a more <a
name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 39</span>enlightened
and creditable feeling, and a higher standard of religious truth
than that afforded by the present version is plainly a
desideratum.&nbsp; The reflections cast upon the Protestant faith
in the recent trials for Bible-burning in Ireland, authorized in
measure by the concessions of Protestants themselves to the
faultiness of the authorized version, wait to be removed.&nbsp;
Let her Majesty, following in this respect the example of James
I., appoint to this work a body of men the most qualified for the
task the realm affords, and we cannot doubt the result will be a
version of Holy Scripture incomparably better than the present;
thus supplying a fresh cause of exultation in her Majesty&rsquo;s
rule, and a surpassing debt of gratitude to the hand that
conferred the boon.</p>

Guizot at a late Meeting of the Protestant Biblical Society in
Paris</i>.&nbsp; <i>See</i> Times, <i>April</i> 19, 1856.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Whether we consider the history of nations,
or the private life of individuals, the moral efficacy and
salutary power of the holy books glowingly manifest
themselves.&nbsp; Undoubtedly, even among nations where it is
assiduous and general, the reading of the holy books has not the
effect of stifling the bad passions of men; it does not obviate
all errors and faults.&nbsp; Man remains full of weakness and
vice, even when conscious of the presence of God.&nbsp; But the
habitual reading of the holy books preserves nations from the
greatest perils; it prevents them from forgetting God.&nbsp; It
has this advantage&mdash;that God remains for them, not an idea,
a name, a system of philosophy, a riddle, but the true and living
God, under whose eye they constantly live, amid the struggles and
casualties of this world.&rdquo;</p>

class="footnote">[3]</a>&nbsp; A solitary voice, in the strict
sense of the word, was raised by the Rev. Canon Selwyn at the
last meeting of Convocation (March, 1856).&nbsp; The motion was
not suited to the <i>mollia tempora fandi</i>, perhaps.&nbsp;
But, whatever the cause, there can be no doubt of the fitness of
the hands into which the motion fell, or that the day is far from
being distant when the question will force itself on the notice
of Convocation, in all probability, in another shape.</p>
<p><a name="footnote4"></a><a href="#citation4"
class="footnote">[4]</a>&nbsp; &ldquo;Essays, Moral and
Literary,&rdquo; by Dr. Vicesimus Knox.&nbsp; No. XLIX.</p>
<p><a name="footnote8a"></a><a href="#citation8a"
class="footnote">[8a]</a>&nbsp; See Psalm xxii. throughout.&nbsp;
The difficulties attending the <i>entire</i> application of the
psalm to Christ are by no means insuperable.&nbsp; Scott
unreservedly refers the whole to Christ.&nbsp; Adam Clarke
dissents.&nbsp; Psalm lxix. is for the most part a manifest
adumbration of the Messiah; and if the difficulties in the way of
the entire application of the Psalm to Christ, presented in verse
5, where he is made <i>apparently</i> to lament his foolishness
and his guilt, could be surmounted, a great boon, it is
conceived, would be granted to all who desire to understand what
they read.&nbsp; The <i>representative</i> scheme, besides being
open to other objections, has no explicit authority in the
Scriptures to recommend it, and the <i>double sense</i> is now
all but universally abandoned.&nbsp; Possibly, if the text will
not yield in these cases, there are principles of interpretation
involved that await future development.</p>
<p><a name="footnote8b"></a><a href="#citation8b"
class="footnote">[8b]</a>&nbsp; Gen. xlix. 21.&nbsp; For,
&ldquo;Naphtali is a hind let loose: he giveth goodly
words,&rdquo; read, &ldquo;Naphtali is a spreading Pine, that
putteth forth goodly boughs.&rdquo;&nbsp; Psa. xxix. 9.&nbsp;
For, &ldquo;The voice of the Lord maketh the hinds to calve, and
discovereth the forests,&rdquo; read, &ldquo;The voice of the
Lord rendeth the pines, and layeth bare the forests.&rdquo;&nbsp;
So Dr. Lee.&nbsp; To surrender the Bible, body and soul, into the
hands of the Massorites, as is required by their pointing of
these passages, is surely asking too much.&nbsp; Let the reader
peruse the <i>whole</i> of the 29th Psalm, and determine the
fitness of the correction for himself, which he may very safely
be allowed to do.&nbsp; The former passage, if consistently
carried out on the principles of the translators, would run,
&ldquo;Naphtali is a hind let loose, <i>that</i> giveth goodly
words,&rdquo; in which the incongruousness of the metaphor would,
if possible, be still more manifest.&nbsp; See Stanley&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Syria and Palestine,&rdquo; p. 355.</p>
<p><a name="footnote10a"></a><a href="#citation10a"
class="footnote">[10a]</a>&nbsp; See Preface to Herwitz&rsquo;
&ldquo;Etymology and Syntax of the Hebrew Language.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="footnote10b"></a><a href="#citation10b"
class="footnote">[10b]</a>&nbsp; See Kitto&rsquo;s Bib. Cyc.,
art. Chronicles.&nbsp; The whole article is very reassuring,
considering the able and accomplished pen from which it
proceeds.&nbsp; The writer, Dr. Davidson, to whom the lovers of
Biblical philology are under the greatest obligations,
deliberately asserts the corruption of the passages in question,
and advocates a reading in conformity with the corresponding
statements in 2 Samuel and Kings.</p>
<p><a name="footnote11a"></a><a href="#citation11a"
class="footnote">[11a]</a>&nbsp; Compare, among other instances
in point that might be given, 1 Kings ix. 28 with 2 Chron. viii.
18.</p>
<p><a name="footnote11b"></a><a href="#citation11b"
class="footnote">[11b]</a>&nbsp; If <i>no</i> purification of the
text should avail us in these cases, it would be advisable to
accompany the change in the text with a note in the margin
explanatory of the corruptness of the reading that has been
superseded.</p>
<p><a name="footnote13"></a><a href="#citation13"
class="footnote">[13]</a>&nbsp; The change of accent the word
undergoes in the original when repeated in the second hemistich,
gives marvellous emphasis to the exhortation&mdash;an emphasis
altogether lost in the translation.</p>
<p><a name="footnote14"></a><a href="#citation14"
class="footnote">[14]</a>&nbsp; The application of this principle
may go some way towards neutralizing the doubts that have been
raised as to the identity of the Isaiah of the later portion of
the prophecy with the Isaiah of the earlier portion.&nbsp; See
chap. lxiv. 10, 11.&nbsp; One thing at least is evident, namely,
that the Apostle Paul, who was confessedly well read in Hebrew
literature, in his quotations from the latter portion of the
prophecy, seems to have had no notion of any other Isaiah than
that to whom the whole prophecy is ordinarily ascribed.&nbsp; See
Rom. x. 16.&nbsp; In fact, these doubts, now complacently
acquiesced in as valid by the Rationalistic School abroad and at
home, were equally unknown to all the world till about half a
century ago.&nbsp; The general reader may content himself with
Dr. Alexander&rsquo;s candid and able investigation of the
question in his recent Commentary on Isaiah.</p>
<p><a name="footnote15"></a><a href="#citation15"
class="footnote">[15]</a>&nbsp; The uses of the particle &#1493;
in combination with the verb.&nbsp; Let the Hebrew student
consult the masterly investigation and elucidation of this
subject in the Hebrew Grammar recently published by Messrs. Mason
and Bernard, Vol. II. chapters 51&ndash;55.</p>
<p><a name="footnote17a"></a><a href="#citation17a"
class="footnote">[17a]</a>&nbsp; This rendering is faulty as not
providing for the emphatic personal pronoun &ldquo;he&rdquo; in
the original.</p>
<p><a name="footnote17b"></a><a href="#citation17b"
class="footnote">[17b]</a>&nbsp; Niphal in the sense of the
Hithpael conjugation.&nbsp; See Gen. xvi. 9.</p>
<p><a name="footnote17c"></a><a href="#citation17c"
class="footnote">[17c]</a>&nbsp; The original will not admit of
this rendering, though the sense is not objectionable.</p>
<p><a name="footnote17d"></a><a href="#citation17d"
class="footnote">[17d]</a>&nbsp; There is great difficulty
here.&nbsp; The word rendered <i>impious</i>, and inserted in
brackets, signifies <i>rich</i>, mostly with an accessory notion
of violence and wrong; but the parallel clause, &ldquo;He made
his grave with the wicked,&rdquo; and the further expression,
&ldquo;He was numbered with the transgressors,&rdquo; in the last
verse, seem to justify the sense here given; and so it has been
understood by some rabbins and other commentators, as Luther,
Calvin, Gesenius.&nbsp; See Matt. xix. 23.&nbsp; We confess we
are not satisfied.&nbsp; The common reading that represents
Christ as rewarded with a grave among the rich, <i>because</i>,
forsooth, he had done no violence, &amp;c., is surely
inadmissible.</p>
<p><a name="footnote18a"></a><a href="#citation18a"
class="footnote">[18a]</a>&nbsp; So, &lsquo;A man of sorrows and
acquainted with grief,&rsquo; v. 3.</p>
<p><a name="footnote18b"></a><a href="#citation18b"
class="footnote">[18b]</a>&nbsp; <i>Intercedes</i> in the
present, because his intercession is a <i>continuous</i>
act.&nbsp; This distinction of tense as contradistinguished from
the past tense in the use of the preceding verb <i>he bore</i>,
expressing a transaction <i>once</i> and <i>finally</i>
concluded, so conspicuous in the original, is entirely overlooked
in the authorized version; so Calvin, Vitringa, Lowth, Henderson,
Jones, Barnes, &amp;c.&nbsp; This concurrence in the
interpretation of the authorized version is especially to be
wondered at in the more recent of the above-named critics.&nbsp;
Messrs. Mason and Bernard give, less happily we think, <i>that he
might make</i>, &amp;c.&nbsp; Dr. Alexander, New Jersey, favours
the view adopted in the amended version.&nbsp; See his admirable
Commentary on Isaiah.</p>
<p><a name="footnote19"></a><a href="#citation19"
class="footnote">[19]</a>&nbsp; A Hebraism lurks here.&nbsp; So,
&ldquo;Praise the Lord, O my soul, and forget not <span
class="GutSmall">ANY</span> of his benefits;&rdquo; and not
&ldquo;<i>all</i> his benefits,&rdquo; as our translation has
it.&nbsp; So again, &ldquo;And God gave Cain a mark, lest <span
class="GutSmall">ANY</span> finding him should kill him,&rdquo;
where the <i>same</i> word is rightly rendered.&nbsp; Ps. ciii.
2; Gen. iv. 15.</p>
<p><a name="footnote24a"></a><a href="#citation24a"
class="footnote">[24a]</a>&nbsp; Various divisions, both of the
Old and New Testaments, were in use from the earliest period, but
the present divisions into Chapters and Verses are ascribed, the
former, with some hesitation, to Stephen Langton, Archbishop of
Canterbury, about the middle of the thirteenth century; the
latter to Robert Stephens, a Frenchmen, about the middle of the
sixteenth century.&nbsp; See art. Scripture in Kitto&rsquo;s
Biblical Cyclop&aelig;dia.</p>
<p><a name="footnote24b"></a><a href="#citation24b"
class="footnote">[24b]</a>&nbsp; In an elaborate translation of
the whole of this prophecy, in the Hebrew Grammar recently
published by Messrs. Mason and Bernard, the authors conceive the
opening passage, &ldquo;<i>Who hath believed our
report</i>,&rdquo; &amp;c., to express the awe and wonder of the
kings mentioned in the previous chapter at the events they are
supposed to witness, and accordingly they render it,
&ldquo;<i>Who hath believed our hearing</i>&rdquo; &amp;c., the
tidings, that is, that have reached us, the kings
aforesaid.&nbsp; But, with all due respect for the translation
generally, we are unable to accept this view of the passage
before us, conceiving it to be far-fetched, and opposed to the
purpose for which, in so many words, it is quoted in the New
Testament.&nbsp; See John xii. 37; Rom. x. 16.</p>
<p><a name="footnote25a"></a><a href="#citation25a"
class="footnote">[25a]</a>&nbsp; In like manner Jacob, in the
course of predicting the future fortunes of his sons, exclaims
parenthetically, &ldquo;I have waited for thy salvation, O
Lord.&rdquo;&nbsp; Gen. xlix. 18.</p>
<p><a name="footnote25b"></a><a href="#citation25b"
class="footnote">[25b]</a>&nbsp; This article has since been
republished in a separate form, under the title of the
&ldquo;Present State of the English Bible,&rdquo; by the Rev.
William Harness, A.M.&nbsp; It will well repay repeated perusal
by all those who are interested in this pre-eminently interesting
question.</p>
<p><a name="footnote28"></a><a href="#citation28"
class="footnote">[28]</a>&nbsp; Let the reader advert for a
moment, in connexion with the argument for the evidences of
Christianity, to the <span class="GutSmall">ASSUMPTIONS</span>
ordinarily and persistently made by Christ in relation to his
person and mission, and then conceive of the <i>frightful
arrogance</i> involved in these assumptions, supposing them to be
unfounded; coupling this thought at the same time with that
perfect sobriety of mind and even tenor of a uniformly staid and
well-balanced deportment by which he was pre-eminently
characterized.&nbsp; <i>We</i> do not find these assumptions in
the slightest degree startling or incredible, because they
comport in our minds with the <span class="GutSmall">WHOLE</span>
character of Christ as developed in the gospel.&nbsp; Where the
evidence of Messiahship failed among his own countrymen, if there
were any failure of <i>evidence</i>, we may advert for the
solution, among other considerations, to their blind disregard to
the perfect compatibility and harmony of these assumptions with
the other features of Messiah as exhibited by Christ.&nbsp; Here
are a few of the expressions alluded to, all taken from the
earlier chapters of St. John&rsquo;s Gospel:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For as the Father raiseth up the dead, and quickeneth
them; even so the Son quickeneth whom he will.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;That all men should honour the Son, even as they honour
the Father.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;The bread of God is he which came
down from heaven, and giveth life unto the world.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;And this is the will of Him that sent me, that every one
which seeth the Son, and believeth on him, may have everlasting
life: and I will raise him up at the last day.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;I am the light of the world; he that followeth me shall
not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of
life.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I and my Father are one.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Jesus saith unto her, I am the resurrection and the life:
he that believeth on me, though he were dead, yet shall he live:
and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never
die.&rdquo;&mdash;How Christ should have preferred <span
class="GutSmall">SUCH</span> claims without legitimate authority,
and ample power to substantiate them, is a question to which we
cannot divine an answer.</p>
<p><a name="footnote30"></a><a href="#citation30"
class="footnote">[30]</a>&nbsp; Some striking illustrations of
this position are to be found in the Appendix to Mr.
Stanley&rsquo;s recent volume on Sinai and Palestine.&nbsp; This
Appendix consists of a vocabulary of topographical words in
Hebrew and English.&nbsp; Great care has been taken in giving the
precise English for the corresponding Hebrew term.&nbsp;
Referring to the previous part of his work, he says, &ldquo;I
have often had occasion to refer to the richness and precision of
the local vocabulary of the Hebrew language.&nbsp; In the
authorized version this is unfortunately lost; not so much by the
incorrect rendering of any particular word, as by the promiscuous
use of the same English word for different Hebrew words, or of
different English words for the same Hebrew word.&rdquo;&nbsp;
And again: &ldquo;The geographical passages of the Bible seem to
shine with new light as these words acquire their proper
force.&nbsp; How keenly, for example, are we led to notice the
early tendency to personify and treat as living creatures the
great objects of nature, when we find that the
&lsquo;springs&rsquo; are the &lsquo;eyes,&rsquo; the bright,
glistening, life-giving eyes of the thirsty East; that the
mountains have not merely summits and sides, but
&lsquo;heads,&rsquo; &lsquo;shoulders,&rsquo; &lsquo;ears,&rsquo;
&lsquo;ribs,&rsquo; &lsquo;loins,&rsquo; &amp;c.&rdquo;&nbsp;
This whole Appendix is deeply interesting to the Hebrew
student.&nbsp; He must feel at the same time how much the mere
English student of Scripture suffers in the absence of the same
knowledge.</p>
<p><a name="footnote31"></a><a href="#citation31"
class="footnote">[31]</a>&nbsp; &ldquo;They who have access to
the Scriptures in the original are . . . endowed with ten
talents, compared with which the power of reading them in our
authorized version is but one.&nbsp; The right improvement of the
one talent will ensure to its possessor the end of his faith,
even the salvation of his soul; but this does not render
guiltless those who have greater talents if, from supineness and
indolence, they neglect to use the enlarged means with which they
are gifted for attaining to the knowledge of the
truth.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Introduction to the Greek Testament,
with Grammatical and Exegetical Notes, by William Webster, M.A.,
and William Francis Wilkinson, M.A.,&rdquo; p. xvi.&nbsp; The
above work has special claims upon that numerous class who, with
little time for elaborate research, are glad to obtain the
<i>results</i> of a thorough critical investigation of the
language and teaching of the New Testament.</p>
<p><a name="footnote34"></a><a href="#citation34"
class="footnote">[34]</a>&nbsp; The following is from
Lewes&rsquo;s &ldquo;Life of Goethe,&rdquo; just published.&nbsp;
The words in double inverted commas are those of Goethe himself:
&lsquo;&ldquo;I had a large collection of weapons, and among them
a very handsome dagger.&nbsp; This I placed by my bedside every
night, and before extinguishing my candle I made various attempts
to pierce the sharp point a couple of inches into my breast; but
not being able to do it I laughed myself out of the
notion,&rdquo; &amp;c.&nbsp; He played with suicidal thoughts,
because he was restless, <i>and suicide was a fashionable
speculation of the day</i>,&rsquo; &amp;c. . . . In October, 1772
the report reaches him that his Wetzlau friend, Gou&eacute;, has
shot himself.&nbsp; &ldquo;Write to me at once about
Gou&eacute;,&rdquo; he says to Kestner, &ldquo;<i>I honour such
an act</i>, <i>and pity mankind</i>,&rdquo; &amp;c.&mdash;Vol. I.
p. 197.&nbsp; There is more to this abominable purpose in the
sequel.&nbsp; Such was Goethe, a man sprung from the people, not
the offspring of an effete noblesse, and at a time of life when
the very thought of self-destruction is most alien to all the
instincts of nature,&mdash;&lsquo;a canker in
youth,&rsquo;&mdash;and with no taint of constitutional
melancholy in his system.&nbsp; Goethe&rsquo;s genius was a sea
of glass, capable of reflecting the rays cast upon it from
without with unusual brilliancy; but, unlike our Shakspeare,
devoid of independent power of originating <i>new</i>
thought.&nbsp; Thus he <i>reflected</i> all his days the
prevailing fashion of his time, and thus he but <i>re-enacts</i>
the sentimentalism of the hour in his suicidal lucubrations.</p>
<p><a name="footnote35"></a><a href="#citation35"
class="footnote">[35]</a>&nbsp; The policy of Pericles may be
considered in relation to the causes that aggrandize a
people.&nbsp; His notion seems to have been that to awaken great
deeds in a nation you must supply it with great and noble
thoughts.&nbsp; Hence his magnificent public buildings, his
lavish cultivation of the arts, and even the attention he paid to
the amusements of the people, to make them subservient to
refinement and purity of taste.&nbsp; But &aelig;sthetics alone
do not make a great people.&mdash;See Thuc. II., 38, 39.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
